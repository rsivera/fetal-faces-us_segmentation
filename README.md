# Segmentation algorithm for Fetal-faces Ultrasound
Atlas-based segmentation algorithm for ultrasound images of fetal faces 

We propose an implementation of the method described by Zuluaga et al. 2013<sup>1</sup>. 

The method requires a task-specific atlas of segmented images that is not included. 

### Dependencies
The script relies on Nifty tools for registration and segmentation.
